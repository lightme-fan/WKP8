# WKP8

Hello! Here's the weekend project 8.

## My step

- Declaring an empty array of songs
- Grabbing elements
- Handling form sumbit
- Showing the new song to the list
- Handling click buttons (Increment and delete buttons)
- Handling increment score
- Handling delete song
- Updating the local storage
- Saving the list of song to the local storage

### These are the most challenging part:
I have done these steps but I am not sure they are working at all.

- Filtering list by search title
- Filter songs by style
- Click the reset filters button, the filter form is reset, and the list comes back to normal.
 
#### I learnt a lot, for example, increasing number by clicking button.

### I would like more explanation on thise steps on the last three steps.
