# WKP8

Hello! Here's the weekend project 8.

## My step

- Declaring an empty array of songs
- Grabbing elements
- Handling form sumbit
- Showing the new song to the list
- Handling click buttons (Increment and delete buttons)
- Handling increment score
- Handling delete song
- Filtering list by search title
- Updating the local storage
- Saving the list of song to the local storage

### If I had more time, I would have done the three steps which I could not finished

###### These are the steps:
- Filtering list by search title
- Filter songs by style
- Click the reset filters button, the filter form is reset, and the list comes back to normal.
 
 My input image does not work. I do not know reason.

 I also have not sorted the song list.
